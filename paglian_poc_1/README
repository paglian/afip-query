WHAT'S THIS?
------------

This is a proof of concept (POC) of a artificial neural network (ANN)
The implementation is based on the book 'Programing Collective Intelligence',
Chapter "Learning from Clicks", page 74.
It also contains some tweaks and improvements such as word lemmatization.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - Python 2.7
 - Qt >= 4.8 (To run the Freeling server)


RUNNING
-------

1) In a new console, start Freeling server:

   $ ./fl --server

2) Train the ANN:

   $ python faqquery.py <FAQ_FILE> --train

   Choose <FAQ_FILE> from ./faqs/

3) Finally, query the ANN with:

   $ python faqquery.py <FAQ_FILE>

   Alternativerly, to do a single query:

   $ python faqquery.py <FAQ_FILE> "<QUESTION>"
