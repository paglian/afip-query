A proof of concept (POC) of an artificial neural network to make natural 
queries to the AFIP database (http://www.afip.gov.ar/)

The POC consists of a back-end that implements the artificial neural network 
and a very simple web front-end to write the queries. The project is written
in Python.

To run the POC see ./paglian_poc_1/README
